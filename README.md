# Library-management-system

 The Library Management System is a full-stack web application. Its main purpose is to allow users to manage a collection of books by performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The system is composed of a modern React + TypeScript frontend that interacts with an ASP.NET Core Web API backend, connected to a SQLite database. This project was designed to demonstrate proficiency in full-stack development, RESTful API design, and responsive design principles.
